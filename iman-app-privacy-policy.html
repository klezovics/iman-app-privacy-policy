    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><small>Effective Date: 19 Aug 2025</small></p>

    <p>Iman (“we”, “us”, “our”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect in the Iman app, how we use it, and your choices. This page is intended for App Store submission and applies to the iOS app.</p>

    <h2>1) What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email address or Sign in with Apple identifier (private relay email where applicable), display name.</li>
      <li><strong>Approximate &amp; precise location (with your permission):</strong> used to determine correct prayer times and time zone for your location and to schedule notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Device data:</strong> push notification token (to deliver alerts), app version, and basic diagnostics/crash logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Referral/attribution data:</strong> campaign information from install links (e.g., Firebase Dynamic Links) to understand how users discovered the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core features (calculate and deliver prayer time notifications for your current location and time zone).</li>
      <li>Authenticate your account and keep your session secure.</li>
      <li>Improve reliability, diagnose issues, and understand high-level usage (non-personal analytics).</li>
      <li>Handle support requests and account changes (including data deletion).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Location data specifics</h2>
    <p>Location access is optional and controlled by iOS permissions. If granted, the app may use precise location to compute accurate prayer times where required. You can disable location at any time in iOS Settings. Without location, you can manually set a city/time zone, but accuracy may be reduced.</p>

    <h2>4) Sharing &amp; selling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We do not sell your personal data.</strong></li>
      <li>We share data only with service providers that help us run the app (e.g., cloud hosting, crash reporting, push notifications, and link attribution). They process data on our behalf under confidentiality and security obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5) Data retention</h2>
    <p>We keep personal data only as long as needed for the purposes above, then delete or de-identify it. You may request deletion at any time (see “Your rights”). Push tokens are removed when you log out or uninstall, and may also expire automatically.</p>

    <h2>6) Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access/Deletion:</strong> email us to access or delete your account and associated personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> you can change location permission and notification settings in iOS Settings.</li>
      <li><strong>EU/UK users:</strong> you may have GDPR rights including access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection, and portability.</li>
      <li><strong>California users:</strong> you may have CCPA/CPRA rights including access, deletion, and the right to know. We do not sell or share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit, restricted access, and monitoring). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we work to protect your data.</p>

    <h2>8) Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us to remove it.</p>

    <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
    <p>Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. We implement measures to protect data during such transfers in line with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>10) Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. We will post the updated version here and update the effective date.</p>
